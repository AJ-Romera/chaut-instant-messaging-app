# About Chaut

Chaut is a messaging app made with the MERN stack, React and vanilla CSS for the frontend, MongoDB as database and Node/express for the backend.

-   I also use pusher for getting and posting the messages in real time (no refreshing).
-   Deployed with Firebase for the frontend and Heroku for the backend.
-   I used some hooks, props, react router and context API.
-   Easy and secure authentication with google.
-   Mobile friendly (Can be improved)
-   Icons provided by Material-Ui.
-   Logo and favicon designed by me using photoshop.

# Important

Disclaimer: The messages are NOT encrypted, so messages are stored in my database!!! Do NOT write sensitive information.
Chaut is a webapp for showing off my skills, It´s not a production work.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
